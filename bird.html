            <li>
                aggressive behavior
            </li>
            <li>

        <p>Be sure to tell your veterinarian if you see signs of any of these symptoms. Just like many illnesses, identifying and treating the symptoms earlier may drastically increase the lifespan of your birdie.</p>
